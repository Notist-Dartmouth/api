Want to make a static version of the feed mockup using React components

Ideally hookup with database by Tuesday

Current problems with boilerplate:
CSS instead of SCSS (or SASS)
Styling is in index.js instead of separate styles folder
Need drawers on both sides
For chat on the right side, just need an empty, collapsible drawer (will later integrate with socket.io)
