Having problems with consistent linting -- in my Atom editor, doing airbnb style but just doing standard when I run `npm start`

Number 1 priority is common/routes/PostList/components/PostListItem

- For chat on the right side, just need an empty, collapsible drawer (will later integrate with socket.io)

How to run:
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
